   							Digital transformation as we know it today is more than turning paper into digital formats or improving channels of business integration and interaction. Our staff have had first-hand experience with how digital transformation has evolved into a more holistic approach in shaping many aspects of the enterprise, such as
 					</p> 		
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <ul>
          <li>Uplifting customer/constituent experience (seamless and wherever, whenever service delivery)</li>

                <em>
                    <p>
A key success factor on every engagement is business enablement. Our preferred consulting approach is to work with client staff so that any strategy, plan or deliverable is created in conjunction with client staff so that it is well understood and accepted. The approach yields a more positive result, reduces the risk of a deliverable not meeting client expectations and has a greater chance of being executed by the client, resulting in a win-win for all.
