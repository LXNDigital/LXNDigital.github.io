                <em>
                    <p>
   							Digital transformation as we know it today is more than turning paper into digital formats or improving channels of business integration and interaction. Our staff have had first-hand experience with how digital transformation has evolved into a more holistic approach in shaping many aspects of the enterprise, such as
 					</p> 		
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <ul>
          <li>Uplifting customer/constituent experience (seamless and wherever, whenever service delivery)</li>
          <li>Business model innovation (operating model transformation including competencies, activities, processes & automation, organizational structure and infrastructure)</li>
          <li>Digital marketing (more effective use of digital channels to market/raise awareness and capture mindshare amidst significant media and news feeds)</li> 
          <li>Governance (improved decision support and risk mitigation through advanced use of information management and analytics)</li>
       </ul>

                <h3 class="text-info">Business Enablement</h3>
                <em>
                    <p>
A key success factor on every engagement is business enablement. Our preferred consulting approach is to work with client staff so that any strategy, plan or deliverable is created in conjunction with client staff so that it is well understood and accepted. The approach yields a more positive result, reduces the risk of a deliverable not meeting client expectations and has a greater chance of being executed by the client, resulting in a win-win for all.

We have a seasoned approach to continuous value alignment for assessing organisational and program performance along the following dimensions
 					</p> 	
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <ul>
		<li> Business alignment – are the right parts of the business aligned with the overall business direction and is the business investment portfolio focused in the right areas? </li>
		<li> Capability alignment – does the business have the right organizational capability in terms of organisation structure, business process, resources and supporting infrastructure to effectively and efficiently deliver on its mission? </li>
		<li> Outcomes alignment – is the business delivering on its outcomes, are the benefits being realised? </li>
       </ul>

    Our staff have provided thought leadership and delivery expertise on several high profile programs of national significance.
