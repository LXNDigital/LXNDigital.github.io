              <h5 class="card-title">Thesis: The Hype Cycle Doesn’t Chart Technology — It Charts Our Infatuation Curve</h5>
              <p class="card-text text-white-50">We like to think of the Hype Cycle as a tidy chart of innovation maturity. In reality, 
                                    it’s a mirror — reflecting our own emotional swings.<br><br> 
                                    By sketching a neat rise–crash–recovery arc, it doesn’t just capture market psychology
                                     — it scripts it. We follow the plot: rush in when novelty dazzles, bail when the shine 
                                     fades. The result? Inflated bubbles, abandoned breakthroughs, and a system where hype outruns merit.<br><br>

                                      Worse, where a technology is placed on the curve can quietly warp decisions. A premature “Peak of 
                                      Inflated Expectations” can send capital stampeding the wrong way; a “Trough of Disillusionment” can stall
                                       promising work until the moment has passed or a rival has seized it. By the time the model signals it’s 
                                      safe to re‑engage, the need may have shifted — or the solution may already belong to someone else.<br><br>

                                      The Hype Cycle seems to shape behaviour at both ends of the adoption curve. For the late majority, 
                                      it can offer comfort — a reason to wait. A “Trough” label can make delay feel like prudence, turning 
                                      inaction into a socially validated strategy. For would‑be early adopters, it can act as a deterrent: 
                                      a “Peak” risks branding them as hype‑chasers, while a “Trough” can make even the curious hesitate. 
                                      In both cases, the chart doesn’t just mirror sentiment — it can influence our sense of when it feels safe 
                                      to act. Strip away the tech gloss and it starts to look like an <strong>Infatuation Curve</strong> — the same arc 
                                      you might recognise in a new romance, a dream job, or the hobby you swore would change your life. 
                                      It’s not necessarily charting capability; it’s charting our highs, our lows, and the rationalisations in between. <br><br>

                                      If we want better decisions, we may need to break the hype habit. <strong>The Innovation Fitness Scorecard</strong> 
                                      can offer one possible alternative — a lens that measures readiness, fit, and value without letting 
                                      sentiment set the tempo. Because the future shouldn’t be dictated by our mood swings, or by the 
                                      comfort of waiting for someone else to go first.
